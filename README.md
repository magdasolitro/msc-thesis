# Master's thesis: Detecting Microarchitectural Attacks
The thesis consists in studying static analysis techniques to detect and mitigate Spectre-like attacks. More precisely, this thesis aims to do a detailed comparison
The current structure is the following:
	1. Introduction
	2. Static Analysis
	3. Spectre
	4. Verification tools to detect Spectre


## 1. Introduction
The first chapter describes the structure of the thesis and summarises motivation, research goals and strategies.

## 2. Static Analysis
The second chapter concerns the theoretical principles of static analysis and explains how it is used to prove security properties of programs.

## 3. Spectre
The third chapter contains a detailed description of Spectre attacks, including all the currently known variants.

## 4. Verification tools to detect Spectre
The fourth chapter talks about the tools that are currently employed to analyse a piece of code to detect microarchitectural attacks such as Spectre.
